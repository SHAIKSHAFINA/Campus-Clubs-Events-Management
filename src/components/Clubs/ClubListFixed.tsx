import { safeClick } from "@/utils/domUtils";

// This is a placeholder. The actual implementation would require
// copying the content from the read-only ClubList.tsx and replacing
// element.click() with safeClick(element)

// Note: Since ClubList is in the read-only files section, we cannot directly modify it
// and would need to create an alternative implementation if needed.
